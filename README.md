# Workday Planner

## Description
 
 One of the best ways of being organized is by having a planner. So I decided to make one so I can stay on top of everything. It works by clicking a hour and writing what you want to write and then clicking the save button. The data is then saved via local storage. The most difficult part of this was getting the local storage to work.
